      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>The acronym "B.A.S.E." (now more commonly "BASE") was coined by filmmaker Carl Boenish,
      his wife Jean Boenish, Phil Smith, and Phil Mayfield.[4] Carl Boenish was the catalyst
      behind modern BASE jumping, and in 1978, he filmed the first BASE jumps to be made using
      ram-air parachutes and the freefall tracking technique (from El Capitan, in Yosemite National
       Park).[5] While BASE jumps had been made prior to that time,
       the El Capitan activity was the effective birth of what is now called BASE jumping.</p>

      <h3>Notable Jumps</h3>
      <p>In 1912, Franz Reichelt, tailor, jumped from the first deck of the Eiffel Tower
        testing his invention, the coat parachute. He died by hitting the ground.
        It was his first ever attempt with the parachute and both the authorities and the
        spectators believed he intended to test it using a dummy.[13]
        In 1913, it is claimed that Štefan Banič successfully jumped from a 15-storey building to
        demonstrate his parachute design.[14][15]
        In 1913, a Russian student Vladimir Ossovski (Владимир Оссовский),
        from the Saint-Petersburg Conservatory, jumped from the 53-meter high bridge over
        the river Seine in Rouen (France), using the parachute RK-1, invented a year before that
        by Gleb Kotelnikov (1872–1944). Ossovski planned to jump from the Eiffel Tower too,
        but the Parisian authorities did not allow it.</p>

      <h3>Comparison with skydiving</h3>
      <p>BASE jumping grew out of skydiving. BASE jumps are generally made from much lower altitudes
        than skydives, and a BASE jump takes place close to the object serving as the jump platform.
        Because BASE jumps generally entail slower airspeeds than typical skydives (due to the limited
        altitude), a BASE jumper does not always reach terminal velocity. Because higher airspeeds
        enable jumpers more aerodynamic control of their bodies, as well as more positive and quick
        parachute openings, the longer the delay, the better.
         BASE jumping is significantly more dangerous than similar sports such as skydiving from
         aircraft.</p>
